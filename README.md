# Apache Spark Repository Has Moved

[Apache Spark](http://spark.incubator.apache.org) is now an incubator 
[Apache](http://www.apache.org) project, and we've moved the codebase.

Spark is now [mirrored on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/incubator-spark) 
at the following repository location:

    git clone git://github.com/apache/incubator-spark.git

Other information including documentation is available on the Spark website: 
[http://spark.incubator.apache.org/](http://spark.incubator.apache.org/)

Thanks!
